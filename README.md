- My first coding project: predict house price in Perce done in JUL, 2018. At that time I just went to Australia and found the house I rent is too expensive, so I wrote a web crawler to collect house data and price from [Real Estate](https://www.realestate.com.au/buy). I also collected the house price in different regions in Perth(with differnet post code) as a variable for analyzing. Finally I found a wonderful house to rent!
